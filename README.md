# Computer science Project Ideas
PC. Com-pu-ter! Practically that is the greatest upheaval that has ever occurred in the human world done by, obviously, the people! They are the man-made mind with modified memory, an alternate cluster of electronic materials, and definitely, with a greater amount of human knowledge. So, Computer Science is one of the occurrence fields in building and with a great deal of degree in future. Indeed, in the event that you are a new kid on the block in this field and feel like lost in a thick backwoods, stress not, I am only here to assist you with the endurance, with the advantage of the thickness of the prosperous woods that you coincidentally stepped in for good. Excuse me for the messy introduction, trust me you will love it.

# Where to start as a beginner?
With so many questions inside the mind, and with a lot more extra information throughout the internet, it is difficult for a software engineer to dig out the right information for him/her.To become a good software engineer, one should go through three phases in his/her career. The first stage would be the Coder. A coder is someone who builds the language of a machine and knows how to speak the language of the same. If a problem is given to a machine, a coder finds a way to deconstruct the problem into instructions and makes the machine come up with the perfect solution. And here is the fun part, you need not even need a proper college education to become a coder. The successful Computer Science career can be achieved if you succeed at coding. But, just coding alone would not get you to greater heights, as this could be learnt by many in easy and simple ways.

The evolution in the career is more important to move forward. So, the next phase would be the Programmer. Well, the programmer is just the elevation of the coder, moreover considered as the sophisticated coder. To make you the sense, coders just write a code that does the job, but the programmers write efficient code that does the job. For this, you should know how to use algorithms and data structures, fundamentals, and the understanding of what makes code more efficient and what doesn't. The mastering of this phase could lead you to get employed in even big companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google.Securing a good job by becoming a programmer doesn't give you relaxation. Here is the twist, there is a third phase called Computer Scientist. More than nitty-gritty details, you must be looking into a big picture like an architect, when you become a computer scientist. This phase leads you to keep updated with the latest technologies and never makes you relaxed with the knowledge that you have already gained. The cooperation with a bigger team and even managing a team would be pretty much the whole thing you would be doing.<br />
Hence, as a beginner, start learning the codes and master the art to achieve big in this field.

- What is the best programming language to learn first?
Now, with that proper stages of a software engineer's life, you might be thinking which language would be easier to go with at the beginning. Fretting over the programming language to go on with would be a waste of time. Instead, I would suggest you focus on the basics and concepts that you would learn in any language. With this piece of advice, you would become a seasoned programmer. Also, you need not try to fund a "perfect" programming language to begin with. Because such a thing doesn't exist and it actually doesn't matter to an extent. Having said that, I can make a few suggestions that you could learn to understand the coding world.

- <b>1. Python</b>

The first language you can consider to learn is Python. With Python, you could even develop some significant projects in a very short amount of time. Even though it is a very high level of language, it is actually very easy to learn. This lets you write a few lines of code with a real program.

- <b>2. JAVA</b>

This language could make you learn different programming concepts that do not exist in Python. You will definitely come to know what I mean when you are done learning both the languages. While JAVA is a statically-typed language, Python is a dynamically-typed one. Learning both the languages would definitely gain you more understanding of any coding and this builds you the basic programming concepts in your mind.
These languages are in high demand in every company which would be employable and form the basic foundation to proceed further in the future.
